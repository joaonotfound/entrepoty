# App Overview
We've included a few GIFs to provide a brief showcase of the design and features that are available on the application. Please note that the design and layout of the application may change over time, so the GIFs may not represent the latest version or the current layout of the app.

### Configure your backend
Deploying the application is straightforward as it is intended to be self-hosted. To use the application, simply deploy your own backend and configure the application to use it. All that's required is the IP and port number of the backend on which it is running.

Please note that at this time, the project does not provide a valid default backend. Therefore, deploying your own backend is currently the only option available.
